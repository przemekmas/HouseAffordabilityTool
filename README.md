# House Affordability Tool

The House Affordability Tool is a web-based application designed to help users in the UK assess whether they can afford a mortgage and manage monthly expenses for a prospective home purchase. By inputting details on savings, salary, home price, and recurring expenses, the tool calculates affordability based on the user's financial situation and the house value they are considering.
